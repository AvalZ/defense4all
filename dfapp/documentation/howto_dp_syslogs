1) DP configuration - programatically configure DP to send syslogs to the DF machines 
	(for every DP, for every interested DF instance):

	how?

2) Rsyslogd configuraion - in each DF machine configure the syslog daemon to receive the syslogs from DP and put them in a pipe:

	In /etc/rsyslogconf uncomment UDP syslog reception:
	
	# provides UDP syslog reception
	$ModLoad imudp
	$UDPServerRun 514
	
	In /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf append the following line at the end:
	
	Local6.* |/var/tmp/rsyslog-pipe
	
3) DPRep code to yank logs from /var/tmp/rsyslog-pipe

	Get the next log entry and act upon the ones relevant for DF
